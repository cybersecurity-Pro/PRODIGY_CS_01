Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Project. This is a simple Python program that lets you encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

If you're not familiar with it, the Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the message by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. It’s a classic encryption method! 🔐

🔑 What It Does
Encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher technique.

Works with both lowercase and uppercase letters.

You can also shift digits (0-9).

Special characters (like punctuation) are left unchanged.

A nice, user-friendly menu helps you pick what you want to do!

📜 How to Use It
First, run the Python script.

The program will give you 3 options:

1 to Encrypt your message.

2 to Decrypt a message.

3 to Exit the program.

When you choose to encrypt or decrypt, just type in your text and pick a shift value. The program will handle the rest! 😊

🧪 Example
Let’s say you have this text: Hello123
You pick a shift value of 3, and it will be encrypted to: Khoor456!

🖥️ What You’ll Need
Python 3.x (If you don’t have it yet, it’s easy to get!)

💻 About Me
I created this project as part of my Prodigy Infotech internship, and I’m super excited to share it with you. Hope you enjoy trying out the Caesar Cipher! ✨
